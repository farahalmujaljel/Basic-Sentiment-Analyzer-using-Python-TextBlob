📊 Basic Sentiment Analyzer using Python & TextBlob
This project presents a simple AI-based sentiment analysis system built with Python and TextBlob to automatically classify customer reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. The system analyzes Amazon product reviews to help sellers understand customer opinions, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions without manual review analysis.
Developed as part of ARTI 303 – Technical Reports, the project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can efficiently process large amounts of unstructured textual data.
